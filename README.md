# Sales_Monitoring_Dashboard_PowerBI

My  project, named "SalesSavvy: Empowering Sales Managers with Data Insights," aimed to address the pressing need for MavenTech to leverage its sales data effectively to drive business growth and improve decision-making processes. The primary goal was to create an interactive dashboard that provided sales managers with comprehensive insights into their team's quarterly performance.

## Business Needs

MavenTech, as a company specializing in selling computer hardware to large businesses, recognized the importance of becoming a data-driven organization. With the adoption of a new CRM system, the company had valuable sales data at its disposal but lacked visibility outside of the platform. The business needed a solution to consolidate and visualize this data in a meaningful way, enabling sales managers to track performance, identify trends, and make informed decisions to optimize sales strategies.

## Discovery and Presentation of Meaningful Insights

To discover meaningful insights, I began by conducting a thorough analysis of the available sales data, including products, accounts, sales teams, regions, and sales performance metrics. This analysis involved identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, deals closed, win rate, and regional sales performance. We also looked for trends and patterns within the data to uncover actionable insights.

In presenting these insights, I focused on creating interactive visualizations that allowed sales managers to explore the data dynamically. This included using charts, graphs, and tables to visualize KPIs over time, by region, and by sales team. I also incorporated drill-down capabilities, allowing users to delve deeper into the data to understand the factors driving performance.
